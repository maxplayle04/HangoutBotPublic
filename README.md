# HangoutBot Public Meta Repository 
Some basic templates which can be used with the more advanced functionality of HangoutBot!

This repository contains some basic examples for server owners and managers to build upon. It contains templates for meta commands you can add to your servers in upcoming updates (if the functionality is not already implemented)

### ðŸ¤– What is HangoutBot?
HangoutBot is the new version of MaxBot, my current self-written Discord Bot. It was my first major project, and as such, contained some pretty terrible code. As such, I plan to rewrite MaxBot under a new, less-like-my-own name, HangoutBot. Originally, it was going to be MaxBot2.0 although I quickly scrapped this idea as I was growing less and less fond of naming a robot after myself, but there you have it.

Right now, it's in core development, meaning it's not very feature rich yet, and definitely does not contain the same amount of commands and other features as its older Brother. But, it'll get there eventually! Baby steps! It will be made public when deemed stable enough to be used properly. Right now, it's only available in select servers - with owners whom I know.

### ðŸ’° Will my MaxBot+ subscription be transferred?
Yes, absolutely! There's no need to purchase anything additional to have the premium plan for both bots. When it's public, you'll have the paid tier for both of the bots, until the older MaxBot is turned off for good!

### ðŸ§‘ Meet the Team!
Right now, it's just myself and Harry Littlewood developing HangoutBot. I hope this team will expand in the future!
